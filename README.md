NetDynamics is data-oriented networking playground for the reliable UDP transports. The application was created for stress testing and debugging a proprietary networking library [HyperNet](https://github.com/users/nxrighthere/projects/1), but it also supports [ENet](https://github.com/nxrighthere/ENet-CSharp) as an open-source alternative.
